# Getting Started: Dockerized Elasticsearch & Kibana

This guide walks you through **four deployment approaches**, from **simple demonstration setups** to **somewhat scalable, production-ready environments**:

| Approach                          | Description                                            | Use Case                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Single-node, no security**   | Basic single-container setup without authentication.   | Learning/demo only, **not for production**.   |
| **2. Single-node, with security** | Adds authentication and TLS.                           | Development/testing with secure access.       |
| **3. Multi-node cluster**         | Multiple Elasticsearch nodes using Docker Compose.     | Resilient, realistic environment.             |
| **4. Multi-node with Kubernetes** | Kubernetes orchestration for Elasticsearch and Kibana. | Production-ready with scaling and automation. |

**Why this order:** Start simple, gradually introduce security and clustering, and finally move to orchestrated, scalable deployments.

>  **Note:** First approach is for demonstration purposes only and should never be used practically.
