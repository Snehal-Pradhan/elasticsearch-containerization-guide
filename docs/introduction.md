# Introduction

### Overview

In modern software systems, **observability**—understanding system behavior from logs, metrics, and events—is critical for reliability and performance.

**Elasticsearch** and **Kibana** form the backbone of the **ELK/Elastic Stack**, enabling **real-time storage, search, analysis, and visualization** of operational data.

### Elasticsearch

**Elasticsearch** is a **distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine** built on Apache Lucene.

It is widely used for:

* Centralized log storage and retrieval
* Full-text search in applications and portals
* Metrics and event data analysis
* Security analytics (SIEM)
* Business intelligence dashboards

**Key strengths:** speed, scalability, horizontal clustering, and millisecond query responses, making it ideal for **high-volume, real-time data applications**.

### Kibana

**Kibana** provides the **visualization and analytics interface** for Elasticsearch.

It allows teams to:

* Explore logs and metrics interactively
* Build dashboards and visualizations
* Monitor system health, request patterns, and errors
* Set alerts and thresholds

**Common use:** Application and infrastructure monitoring, security analytics, and operational insights.

### Tech Ecosystem Context

Elasticsearch and Kibana integrate with tools like:

* **Prometheus/Grafana** – Metrics visualization
* **Fluentd/Filebeat/Logstash** – Log ingestion
* **OpenTelemetry** – Tracing
* **AWS OpenSearch** – Managed Elasticsearch

Combined with **Docker**, they enable **scalable, containerized, production-ready observability solutions**.
